        <p class="general"> This summer, I am attending the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Microsoft Boston. The program is for girls who are interested in coding and provides them the resources to cultivate that interest and learn more about both coding and what it's like to be a woman in the field of computer science. In terms of currciulum, the program is the equivalent of one semester of an introductory college computer science course; it covers Scratch, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Arduino programming with C++.

    	<p class="general" style="overflow-y: scroll; overflow-x: scroll"> Girls Who Code has been an incredible experience. It's only been four weeks but I've already learned so much. I had no idea what I wanted to do or even if I wanted to pursue computer science in college. I'd taken an intro to Java course in my school and while it was interesting, it wasn't more interesting than my other classes. Because of Girls Who Code, I learned about many different careers that I could go into with a computer science degree. I've learned that I can code and that I'm not behind; compared to a lot of the experiences of the women in tech who we met and spoke with, the other girls in the program and I definitely have a leg up.

        The program has definitely made me wonder why more girls aren't in computer science fields. It's not for lack of skill, ability, or interest. Historically, women have been avid programmers. Many of the first progammers were female (Grace Hopper, Ada Lovelace, etc.). Recently, girls have been edging out of the field they helped to create. I believe that girls aren't in computer science anymore because it's become such a male-dominated field; they're too intimidated to even apply for a job. We need to face this intimidation together and cultivate a nework to support each other on those days when we're told that or feel like we can't code or that we don't belong or that we don't deserve to be where we are. <strong>And Girls Who Code is developing this network.</strong></p>
