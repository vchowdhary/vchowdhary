<h class="carbon-copy-title"> <strong> Self-Reliance and the </strong><i><strong>Dead Poets Society</strong></i></h>
<br>
<br>
<p class="essays_paragraph">
In Peter Weir's film <em>Dead Poets Society</em>, several boys at an extremely repressive boarding school, Welton Preparatory Academy, are inspired to be self-reliant by their unconventional English teacher, Mr. Keating, and demonstrate the effects of the following the transcendentalist philosophy. Todd Anderson initially does not appear to be influenced by the philosophies described in Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self-Reliance"; however, as the film progresses, he is pushed to his limits by his interactions with Mr. Keating which push him to his limits and his friendship with Neil. By witnessing Neil's infectious joy upon defying his father to pursue his dream of acting in a play and learning of Neil's subsequent suicide, Todd better understands Emerson's philosophies and the true meaning of carpe diem. Ultimately, because of his involvement in the Dead Poets Society and his intense personal interactions with Neil and Mr. Keating, Todd realizes both the advantages and consequences of following Emerson's transcendentalist philosophy and becomes self-reliant nevertheless.

            Mr. Keating's intense, nontraditional teaching style forces Todd to express his opinions and show his true self; by successfully doing so, Todd's confidence in himself and Emerson's philosophies is bolstered and he is encouraged to continue to express himself. When Todd has to write a poem for Mr. Keating's class, he rips out all of his attempts and "dismisses without notice his thought because it is his"; Todd believes that his ideas are worthless solely because they are his. Mr. Keating is aware of Todd's insecurities and calls him out on them, telling Todd that "something inside of you is worth a great deal". By forcing Todd to improvise a poem on the spot, Mr. Keating pushes him to take the opportunity to express himself without over-thinking because he might not get it again, or he would then be forced to "take with shame [his] own opinion from another" because he didn't speak up; furthermore, because of the positive results of his bravery, Todd realizes that there is a "power which resides in him" and that he won't know the extent of his greatness until he's tried; Todd was relieved when he "put his heart into his work and [did] his best" by revealing the purest, most genuine form of his thoughts; prior to this experience, his passivity prevented him from ever being at peace. By being pushed to his limits by Mr. Keating, Todd overcame his cowardice and gained self-confidence, consequently understanding the advantages of following a carpe diem philosophy.

    Todd's friendship with Neil was also a driving force in his becoming more self-reliant. Initially, Todd discourages Neil from trying out for the play by reminding him of his father and how he would disapprove of Neil's actions. However, when Neil ignores him and gets the main part in the play, Todd witnesses Neil's excitement at defying his father and following his passions. Although he still reminds Neil of the consequences of his decisions, Todd seems to be invigorated by Neil's joy and total disregard for anyone else's opinions. Like Mr. Keating, Neil pushes Todd to stop just observing and participate more in life: "being in the club means being stirred up about things...you have to do something, not just saying you're in", to which Todd replies that he's not like that. Todd doesn't trust himself as he believes that he can never be as confident and open about his opinions as Neil, having had to live up to high expectations all his life. Despite Todd's reluctance to step out of his shell, Neil continues to encourage Todd to be less conformist. Todd has always "capitulated to the badges and names", living his life based on how society thought he should as the younger brother of the valedictorian. However, when Todd receives a desk set from his parents for his birthday, he is spurred on by Neil's words and he throws it over the bridge, symbolizing his freedom from the staunch conformity that his parents expected of him. He was "clapped into jail by his consciousness", perpetually worried about what he was expected to do or say, thus imprisoning his true self. When Todd throws away the desk set, he realizes that "nothing can bring [him] peace but himself" and letting every one of his actions be genuine with no consideration whatsoever for what anyone else expected from him. Todd both learns the advantages of nonconformity and experiences them because he witnesses Neil's happiness from doing what he wanted despite others opinions and did the same with encouragement from Neil.
<br>
<br>
    After Neil's suicide, Todd understood the risks and repercussions of nonconformity and thus supported Mr. Keating when he was fired but did not sacrifice his education. Todd grieves deeply when Neil kills himself but despite the school's accusations that Mr. Keating was responsible, Todd doesn't blame his teacher as he knows that in trying to live life to the fullest and seize the day, to "suck the marrow out of life", Neil had "choked on the bone". Neil couldn't handle the repercussions of nonconformity and thus he chose to end his life to escape from his father's seemingly perpetual disappointment in him. However, Todd understands that "to be great is to be misunderstood" and that there is a time for daring and a time for caution; therefore, Todd is cautious when the school coerces him into signing the affidavit that Mr. Keating was responsible for Neil's suicide, despite wanting to say otherwise. He understands that it is not worth it to get expelled from Welton and sacrifice his education. However, Todd openly shows that he disagrees about Mr. Keating's verdict by being the first to stand on his desk and say "O captain, my captain", a phrase that suggests his reverence and awe for Mr. Keating and his teaching. By standing on his desk, Todd declared that he thinks differently as Mr. Keating had encouraged the boys to do earlier in the film. Todd's actions at the end of the film demonstrate that he is willing to be a nonconformist despite the risks.
<br>
<br>
    Peter Weir's film The Dead Poets Society suggests that a truly self-reliant person is genuine in his thoughts and actions but also knows that nonconformity had some risks, as described by Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay "Self-Reliance". Todd Anderson's progression from a scared, shy boy to a confident and more self-reliant shows that it is necessary to ignore your fear in order to be a nonconformist. His interactions with Mr. Keating and Neil pushed him to his limits and encouraged him to be more confident, so he could reap the benefits of nonconformity. Finally, Todd understands the consequences of nonconformity when Neil commits suicide but chooses to be a nonconformist despite that, proving that he is truly self-reliant. Through his film The Dead Poets Society, Peter Weir encourages people to be like Todd and forgo their fear in order to truly experience life to the fullest but still remain mindful of the risks of nonconformity.
