A wall lamp hangs in my foyer. It is a modest size - not too big but not too small. Bright colors of dancing flowers yell out at people as they pass by, complemented by the quieting and calming presence of dark green leaves and flowing water. Brilliant LED lights surround the inside of the lamp's frame, creating a mosaic of light that floods the foyer with light when turned on. My mother and I created this lamp together during the summer before eighth grade, spending many grueling hours meticulously painting each individual flower and making trips to the nearest art store to get more paints. It was the best summer of my life. My mom and I still get compliments about the ingenuity of our lamp to this day; some days I look at it and wonder, how could I have ever made something so supposedly creative? I've never felt like an extraordinarily creative person before. 
<br>
<br>
Leonardo Da Vinci, Vincent Van Gogh, Steve Jobs, and Ludwig Van Beethoven are some of the most famous people in history, renowned for their breakthrough innovations and beautiful art, all of which have left have a lasting impression on the world. I've always wondered where their endless reservoir of creativity came from: is it genetic, environmental, or something else entirely? Some people hypothesize that it is because of their brains, while others believe that they were simply born creative and there's nothing anyone can do to become more creative. Still others believe the exact opposite, that our creativity is controlled by us and our behavior, not by our genes or brain. If that's the case, how does one become more creative? Throughout this essay, I will endeavor to determine what the origin of creativity really is and if that creativity is fixed or flexible. 
<br>
<br>
I began my search by reading an article called "Creativity" from the International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences as I had minimal background information on this topic. However, since the article was written in 1968, I verified the information by reading in tandem another article also unfortunately titled "Creativity" (and here I thought articles about creativity would have creative names) in the Annual Review of Psychology, written by Mark Runco in 2004. 
<br>
<br>
Both articles first addressed my doubts about the "right brain-creativity" theory, the theory that creative people only use their right brain, or conversely, that only right brain people are creative. According to the encyclopedia article, creative people use both divergent and convergent thinking. The former focuses on analysis and reasoning (and can thus be measured by numerical, traditional tests like an IQ test) whereas the latter produces diverse and novel ideas (and can be measured by new, unconventional tests such as the Torrance test) (1). The amount of convergent versus divergent thinking a creative person uses depends on the task they complete (1). I suppose that if convergent thinking and divergent thinking represent the left and right brain respectively, then the encyclopedia refutes the right-brain theory (1). 
<br>
<br>
Mark Runco verifies this statement in his article, providing further scientific evidence; in a study, Roger Sperry (winner of a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine) performed commissurotomies, surgeries that remove the corpus callosum (which connects the left and right brain), from participants to treat their seizures, affecting skills that were "more aligned with simultaneous and sequential processing" (1) than those that were associated with creativity. In fact, because of the removal of the corpus callosum, the individuals lacked the coordination of their cerebral hemispheres, so they could not describe their emotions (1). Communication between the two sides of the brain is crucial to self-reflection, which enhances creativity (1). I too have found that I use a lot of my skills from English and history (stereotypically right-brain oriented) in my math and science classes (which are stereotypically left-brain oriented) and vice versa. This suggests that creative thinking doesn't come from one side of the brain, but rather the union of the two hemispheres of the brain which is supported by both the encyclopedia article and Runco's article.
<br>
<br>
According to the encyclopedia article, there are several cognitive and motivational factors that inhibit a person's creative ability. It states that people who are too rigid with information, overly analytical, or too quick to jump to conclusions cannot understand the problem, thereby hindering their creative process (1). Making assumptions has also lead me to narrow my field of possible solutions many times in the past. The following factors can diminish a person's creativity: a lack of motivation due to being overly concerned about external, materialistic rewards as opposed to internal rewards and a fear of failure, nonconformity, or others' opinions of their actions. Being less concerned about these things enhances a person's creative ability (1). I've noticed that my fears have inhibited my creativity before too; I always hesitated in class last year to ask questions or offer opinions because I was afraid people would judge me while others never failed to offer creative and intelligent insights. Fear prevents you from thinking freely, like Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his essay â€œSelf-Reliance". All of these factors suggest to me that a major component of someone's creativity is their ability to think freely, without concerns or fears.
<br>
<br>
Runco's article doesn't talk about fear as a potential inhibitor, instead referring to more scientific and anthropological enhancers of a person's creativity. He claims that time is an important part of the creative process: contrary to popular opinion, creativity isn't an 'aha' moment or a simple 'eureka!' In fact, much research has indicated that the most creative ideas are remote from the initial idea; creative people "take time to move from idea to idea to idea to find the 'remote associate'" (1), the most loosely connected thought from the first. Sounds like letting ideas marinate (maybe even an idea for the I-Search paper) helps you come up with the most creative idea (1). According to Runco, birth order is also an important determining factor of a person's creativity. Middle children generally grow up to be rebellious and nonconforming (and thus have the potential to be very creative) because growing up with an older sibling pushes the child to develop their own unique niche through original thinking (1). I'm the middle child; maybe that's why I'm the artist in my family and neither my sister nor my brother can draw a straight line. In addition, children who are raised androgynous (that is, neither as a stereotypical male nor a female) "tend to have more options available when solving problems" because they "may be more flexible than the stereotyped male or female" (1) since they tend not to prefer typically masculine or feminine solutions. Like the encyclopedia article, Runco suggests that having an open and nonconforming mind is an important determining factor of creativity.  <br>
<br>
Both articles also refute the so-called "mad genius controversy", a theory cultivated by popular culture in which creative people are supposed to be psychopaths: they state that although creative people are not psychopaths, they have similar brain function and cognitive processes. This is alarming; does my creativity attribute to my social awkwardness and inability to relate to others well, or is that just a trait of nerdiness? Upon reading the two articles, I developed a strong base of knowledge, and this inspired further research.
<br>
<br>
    I wondered whether there was any merit to the 'mad genius controversy' mentioned above, so I consulted another source; using the references from Mark Runco's article, I found out about a leading creativity expert named Arne Dietrich who'd written many articles specifically on the cognitive neuroscience of creativity. Among this treasure trove, I also found an article he'd written entitled "The Mythconception of the Mad Genius" where he debunked the myth of the mad creative genius. In this article, Dietrich outright states that no scientific evidence indicates that creativity is linked to psychopathology and backs up his claim with data on the incidence and prevalence of mental illnesses. About a fifth of the entire human population has either mood or anxiety disorders, with some additional people also afflicted with schizophrenia, substance abuse disorder, personality disorders, and autism, adding tens of millions more to this already large population. According to Dietrich, "the vast majority of creative people are not mentally ill and, more importantly, the vast majority of those suffering from psychopathology are not geniuses" (2). It was an interesting and logical approach to answering the question of the mad genius, leaving me ashamed of ever believing that a so-called mad genius could exist because of how preposterous Dietrich made the idea sound. However, this realization also raised a few questions: was there any neuroscientific evidence that indicated that creativity was linked to psychopathology? If no evidence supported this theory, then why was it such a widespread and common belief that even my five-year old neighbor knew and believed?
<br>
<br>
 Dietrich answered the latter question in his article as well, stating that the reason people believe in the nonexistent creativity-madness link is because of a cognitive mechanism called the availability heuristic, "a mental shortcut that estimates the likelihood or frequency of an event by the ease with which a specific instance of it comes to mind" (2). That's why when thinking about psychopathology in relation to creativity, people are more likely to use Michael Jackson as a guideline that the 99% of normal cases, because that 99% doesn't get nearly as much attention from the media as the 1% like Jackson's case (2). In such a case, the pairing between the person's madness and their creativity is so vivid that people tend to mix the ideas together and overestimate the frequency of them occurring together, thus leading them to believe that the two are linked. It was a Fahrenheit 451-esque explanation as it reminded me of how Mildred was so ignorant and superficial; similarly to her, because of the multitude of examples that are shoved at us through the media, we are ignorant in believing that the mad genius is the rule, not the exception,. In actuality, creative imagination and expression is the "hallmark of a well-adjusted, self-actualizing, fully functioning person" (3) - definitely not a psychopath. I'm sure that the many creative people I know and I are not psychopaths (although I have my doubts about certain friends).
<br>
<br>
The next article I found lifted my spirits, albeit only a small amount as it too was inconclusive; it was written by Manfred Kayser and was entitled "Editor's Pick: mad and genius in the same gene?". Kayser writes about studies have suggested that the neuregulin 1 gene could be a candidate gene for psychosis. A particular genotype determines a mutation in the promoter of this gene, leading to a heightened gene expression which is â€œassociated with an increased risk of psychosis and other psychological and neurological phenotypes" (1). Szabolcs Keri, a scientist at the Semmelweis University in Budapest, recently investigated whether this particular genotype could heighten a person's creativity, attempting to resolve the 'mad genius controversy' once and for all. He studied 200 very intellectual (I doubt how objective this description is, although it was stated that the volunteers underwent a battery of rigorous tests to determine their intellectual ability) volunteers and tested their genotype. Those that had this particular genotype had statistically much higher creativity than others; Keri concluded that the neuregulin 1 gene has a "significant impact on human creativity" (1). However, this may not be enough to conclusively prove that genius and madness are genetically related to each other because there is no proof of causality given: like my math teacher aptly explained in eighth grade, just because the number of cats and the number of skateboards both increased in one year, one did not necessarily cause the other. Keri admits that there are flaws in his study: for one, all his findings are from a selected group of highly intellectual people but the same results might not be supported in the general, more varied population (1). In addition, there is doubt as to whether neuregulin 1 actually is responsible for psychosis. Nevertheless, this article was helpful because it delved more into actual genetic research as opposed to behavioral psychology, which although interesting, provided evidence for neither the existence nor the absence of a biological link between creativity and psychopathology (1). It's clear that more research is needed on this subject, but for now I'm content with saying that the link between creativity and psychopathology is probably negative and definitely shaky at best. 
<br>
<br>
    My findings did, however, make me wonder whether there was a gene for creativity like there was potentially a gene for psychosis. I consulted Arne Dietrich's collection of articles and found another paper, entitled "The Cognitive Neuroscience of Creativity". Dietrich wrote that the prefrontal cortex of your brain is crucial to creative ability because it allows you to integrate their conscious experiences, producing novel ways to apply known information to art and science. I think that being able to take what knowledge you have and apply it in novel and useful ways is the true definition of creative ability. By integrating information, the prefrontal cortex enables the following human functions: "self-construct, self-reflective consciousness, complex social function, abstract thinking, cognitive flexibility, planning, willed action, source memory, and the theory of mind", which are all major tools of creativity (3). Creativity can occur because of both careful and extensive attention (like the heavy lifting we do for all of our essays) and a lack of focus (like when someone comes up with good ideas while in the shower). The prefrontal cortex is partly responsible for the large range of the attention that needs to be devoted to creativity. In addition, creativity uses a selection process that is similar to Darwin's natural selection; a person comes up with a large variety of ideas all the time, but "a selection process is required to determine which ideas are truly creative" (5). According to Dietrich, every person has the neural circuits possible to make different combinations of information they already know. However, only certain people have the higher order structures that can "assess a set of very complex and constantly changing rules such as the values implicit in a person's culture", suggesting that all people are creative, but some people are more creative because of the organization of their brain which provides them with the aforementioned selection process.
<br>
<br>
Now that I knew what part of the brain was involved in creativity, I wanted to delve deeper into the genetics. I went back to the database and searched specifically for "genetic creativity"; some of the results were absurd, but a study entitled "Dopamine and the Creative Mind: Individual Differences in Creativity Are Predicted by Interactions between Dopamine Genes DAT and COMT" by Darya Zabelina looked very promising (but also daunting). The article described the dopaminergic system (DA), a group of nerve cells that includes the prefrontal cortex and is involved in the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. It was hypothesized to be involved in divergent thinking (a part of creativity). Zabelina considered two candidate genes for creativity: DAT and COMT. The first gene codes for the enzyme COMT, which degrades dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. A particular mutation in this gene causes a change in the COMT enzyme structure, thus affecting dopamine synthesis and interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the midbrain involving dopamine. Variations in the DA transporter (DAT) gene, which is responsible for the uptake of dopamine in the striatum of the brain, are associated with "variation in the availability of DA transporters and striatal DA levels" (1). Dopamine levels in "multiple brain areas affect human creativity, with an interaction between frontal and striatal dopaminergic pathways" (1).
<br>
<br>
 Wondering whether there was more evidence to support this, I went to Google Scholar and searched for DAT, COMT, and creativity; one of the results had an author with a very familiar name: Mark Runco. In his study "The Genetic Basis of Creativity and Ideational Fluency", Runco considered the following dopamine genes which were associated with a fluency of ideas (the ability to generate a large quantity of ideas): dopamine transporter (DAT), catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR), and tryptophase hydroxylase (TPH1). However, originality, not fluency, is vital for creativity, although fluency does enhance creative ability. For some people, the large number of ideas they produce are "elaborated, evaluated, filtered, and adapted such that some ideas become original and creativity is eventually expressed" (1), through a selection process like the one Dietrich mentioned above. Only ideational fluency has a genetic basis, but experiences (which are an environmental factor) also have a huge influence on creativity (1). Runco, Zabelina, and Dietrich's research suggests to me that although there is a genetic basis of creativity, there is also an environmental influence on it.
<br>
<br>
    Now that I knew the genetic basis for creativity, I began to revise my initial questions from when I started my researching. Instead of wanting to know how I individually could become more creative, I wondered how our society as a whole could be more creative. Upon my initial search for creativity in the Academic OneFile database, I'd found an article that seemed interesting and had bookmarked it for later reading; the article was called â€œChildhood into the 22nd century: creativity, the Finland example, and beyond" and authored by Sara Kapadia. Kapadia stated that as a society, we are entering a conceptual change as a response to the long "information age", where "outsourcing, offshoring, automation and other mechanical skills" (1) were valued. Now there is a rise in demand for creative minds: the world wants people who use creativity to make meaning out of things, and education is vital in training the next generation to do so. Finland's education policy is world-renowned and definitely encourages creativity in Finnish students. Children in Finland receive little homework and lots of opportunities for creative play, yet continue to get the best results. In addition, teachers in Finland are rigorously trained to meet the needs of diverse learners so all students could think critically and solve problems effectively (1). Furthermore, children are encouraged to understand themselves and their individuality in regards to their peers, thus being attentive to not only their interests but to others' individual interests and being receptive of this diversity (1). I'd heard of Finland's phenomenal education system before, but this article made me appreciate it even more and dislike our education system in comparison. I am fortunate to be here in Westborough, Massachusetts, at an amazing high school with amazing teachers, but the United States as a whole isn't the same as Westborough in terms of education.
<br>
<br>
Another article titled â€œAmbivalent emotional states, the underlying source of all creativity" by Simon A. Moss and Samuel G. Wilson was referenced in this article. Intrigued, I sought out this paper, which claimed that ambivalent emotions (those that are both positive and negative) enhance a person's creativity. For example, both nostalgia and compassion are ambivalent emotions and they enhance creativity; nostalgia is ambivalent because a person experiences both warmth and a tinge of loss as they reminisce about their past and compassion is ambivalent because one feels warmth towards someone or something but also worry and protectiveness towards them. This has very important implications. Practitioners can try to create situations where people experience ambivalent emotions, such as by encouraging â€œmore debates, perhaps to increase the receptivity of employees to contradictory perspectives" (1). Given that ambivalent emotions enhance creativity, the diversity in Finnish schools would increase every Finnish child's ability to think creatively. The concept of ambivalent emotions somehow enhancing creativity was very surprising to me, but as I think about it more, it makes a lot of sense; a huge part of creativity is having an open mind and a wide range of experiences, so clearly ambivalent emotions would help with this because they would encourage people to tolerate other's ideas and learn from the conflicting emotions they experience. 
<br>
<br>
I followed the breadcrumb trail back to my original database search and stumbled upon an article by Lori Flint entitled â€œHow creativity came to reside in the land of the gifted (and how to move it into a new neighborhood)". It answered a very important question that plagues the minds of many: why is the U.S. so behind in education? In the 1960's and 70's, gifted children were defined as those who showed potential in academic ability, general intellect, creativity, leadership, or the arts; this definition allowed the government to not only identify kids but also to use the government's resources to educate a select group to their highest potential in an egalitarian society. This reeks of government conspiracy (I couldn't resist). Because of the No Child Left Behind policy, teachers are under pressure to make sure that all of their students learn the tested material, eliminating any room or time for creativity (1). My peers and I have experienced this May-June end of the year rush countless number of times (and I'm sure you can relate to this all too well, Mrs. Roney). However, creativity education is something that would benefit all kids, not just gifted ones. Education policy should include encouraging creative achievement by teaching skills like "finding humor, taking responsible risks, thinking interdependently, gathering data through all the senses, and more", as these are important life skills (1). In addition, mixing movement, drama, and music with any lesson turns it into engaging and memorable learning (1) - just another reason to act out Othello. It's clear that the United States needs to catch up in creativity; the best way we can do this is by tailoring an education policy that is inclusive, encourages diversity, and extensively covers multiple domains while still setting national standards and requirements and enforcing the No Child Left Behind policy. Obviously, this is easier said than done. 
<br>
<br>
I began my search with certain questions in my head about the potential origins of creativity; however, my research took me down a curvy, meandering path with lots of little very tempting alleys and brooks, not the straightforward yellow-brick road I'd been expecting. Although there has been a lot of research in the area of creativity, there's still a lot more to conclusively proven, so many of my questions don't have definite answers; however, I'm okay with this as the research itself was rewarding for this reason too, as it allowed me to see the complexities in a person's creativity.
<br>
<br>
 I found that creativity is an innate ability that all people have. However, there are some of us who are more creative than others because their prefrontal cortex is able to differentiate between creative and non-creative ideas, Furthermore, although all of us are able to generate ideas, some individuals (hypothetically because of their genes) are able to both generate a large and varied number of ideas and sort through those ideas. I'd also discovered during my search that there are behavioral and social aspects to a person's creativity; most often, creative people (like transcendentalists) are nonconformists and are unafraid of both people and failure. Interested in the mad genius myth, I went down one of the particularly tempting alleys about the mad genius myth; however, my efforts did not reap any conclusively answers. It is generally accepted that the mad genius myth is just that - a myth. Upon learning about all of the qualities of creative people, I wondered how our country could become more creative. A frequently occurring answer to my question was by increasing diversity and tolerance to encourage ambivalent emotions and open-mindedness, as this leads to enhanced innovation and creativity.
<br>
<br>
 My I-Search experience was very rewarding; it taught me a lot about myself, as I could relate to many of the characteristics described of creative people. My one complaint is that it left me dissatisfied about a lot of the questions I had, but this is simply because the field of creativity research is still in its infancy because it is, quite frankly, daunting. I still wonder what role practice plays in creativity, as my research didn't reap much information on this (with the exception of the ten year rule). Creativity is such a subjective trait, making me wonder whether the claims presented in my research applies to all creative people. Do all creative people need time to come up with creative ideas?  I know that I've produced creative work under the pressure of a burgeoning deadline too many times before. Despite the pitfall of inconclusive research and the many unfinished roads (questions left unanswered), I quite enjoyed my walk down this meandering road as it opened my eyes to the complexities of even a single human trait like creativity.
