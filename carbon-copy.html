<p class="essays_paragraph"> At the very back of my closet, there lies a battered old box, and in that box lies a picture. It's a well-worn picture, corners faded from age and the colors not quite as sharp as they used to be. There are two girls around the age of three, maybe even younger, completely indistinguishable from each other (even to me). One grins at the other, who looks to the camera at the last minute, a ghost of a smile still on her face. It's hard to believe that a minute ago, they were probably ready to claw each other's faces off. Their grins are joyous, like they have their own little inside joke that no one else is privy to. I look at their picture now and then and wonder, what's their secret? <em>Sometimes, I don't remember the answer.</em> <br>
  <br>
  My sister and I are fraternal twins - however, we looked the same for most of our formative years and only started developing distinct facial differences when we were about thirteen. For thirteen years of my life, we were one inseparable entity: thus, I had no personal identity. I was a ghost. I was a clone. (At least to the majority of the world, I was.) I can vividly recall many years of being called my sister's name and being expected to respond (even despite my corrections). That's why even to this day, I don't bother to correct people if they call me by my sister's name; I'm numb to it, as our identities have blended together so much that it feels like whatever experiences she has, I have too. And it's not just me who feels that way. Many times our friends will reference a joke or story they told to my sister and tease at my blank, uncomprehending stare, "How could you've already forgotten this story? I just told you this (insert time length ranging from one day to one week here)!"A question to which I respond drily, "That was my sister, not me. You can tell the difference because I'm prettier." They shake their heads at me and declare (as if they know what it's like to be a twin) "you're supposed to read her mind or something". I scoff and state in my most derisive tone, contrary to popular belief, twin telepathy is not a real thing. This is not an uncommon conversation, but it is very effective. When I was nine years old, I became convinced that my sister and I really were the same person. My Girl Scout troop had visited the police station and had gotten to see what our fingerprints looked like; when it was our turn to see, the other girls joked that my sister and I would have the same fingerprint. To my surprise, we did (well,it wasn't really the same, but it looked like at the time): it was an eye-opening and crushing moment as my immature nine-year-old self dramatized the situation into being proof that I was my sister and she was I. Although I now know that we actually aren't clones, the feeling of not being a whole person has stayed with me. <br>
  <br>
  My sister and I are best friends (fact). We have other friends besides each other (another fact). Here's a lesser known fact: our friendships are affected detrimentally because of us being twins. We've always made friends together, with both of us introducing ourselves to the prospective friend and judging their response: it's a warning, a moment of vulnerability, and a test all at once, like we're declaring "this is who we are, a package deal...do you still want us?" We make it clear even from the infancy of the friendship that we have a tumultuous but everlasting relationship; no matter how much we yell at or fight each other, our friends know that my sister and I are best friends (with the most literal possible meaning of the phrase) and that they will never come close to having as strong of a bond with either of us as we do with each other. It's often caused our friends to cling to each other, so they don't feel excluded; it's become such a habit that even if I'm on my own, my friends (unconsciously) treat me like I'm with my twin, leading to them unintentionally excluding me. It's happened quite frequently to me this year especially; sometimes I sit in class, surrounded by my friends and peers, yet I feel so alone. <br>
  <br>
  Like any other person who has a sibling, I've wondered from time to time what my life would be like if I wasn't a twin: what it would be like to be a whole, individual person. Sometimes, the idea seems very enticing (my own room, finally!) and other times, I'm overwhelmed by how lonely I would feel if I didn't have my sister's constant, reassuring presence. I've wondered what it would be like to not have to share my clothes, my toys, my time, my life, with another person - what would it be like to have something of my own? Recently, we've been exploring that question, experimenting to try and determine an answer. One of the few interests I have that my sister doesn't is art. I love to draw, paint, create, anything! My sister, however, is completely averse to anything that involves picking up a pencil or paintbrush (she can barely draw a straight line). I often feel a huge sense of satisfaction and joy when I create art because it's finally something that I can call my own - no one can call my paintings 'Shreya and Vanshika's paintings': they are a product of my effort and creativity only, an expression of my individual and unique personality. But other times, I wish that my sister did also share an interest in art so I could share my passion with her instead of just telling her about it. In addition, having an older brother gives me the unique perspective of being not only a twin but also a regular sister. I've noticed  a profound difference between being a sister and being a twin - being a twin feels more confined, as I know I'm stuck with this person for my entire life, whereas being a sister gives an expectation that I will separate from my brother eventually. I think this inescapable codependence is the cause of my greatest fear: that I will not be able to survive without my sister. I yearn for independence, yet I hate the thought of being away from my sister. I crave individuality, yet I dream of living next door to her with matching houses and golden retrievers. Ultimately, I need to leave the security blanket of being a twin and brave the cold touch of independence on the soles of my feet. <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the first time that I've really done that. It's chilled my toes and caused goosebumps to rise on my skin, but I've warmed up: I've survived. This is the first time ever that my sister and I do not have any classes together. Zip. Zilch. Nada. To really emphasize the effect of this, let me do some quick math. I wake up at around six-thirty and get to school at about ten past seven (forty minutes). My sister and I sit with each other at our lockers until the first bell rings at seven-thirty (sixty minutes). We talk at break for another ten minutes (one hour and ten minutes now) and then for five-ish minutes after fourth period. I don't see her again until the end of the day, and that's on a good day. Throughout most of the school year, I don't see her until dinner that day at seven and then I'm with her until I sleep at ten. On some days, I see my sister for a grand total of four hours and fifteen minutes (out of the twenty-four hours in a day). That's less than the amount of time it took to write this essay. Last year, that was the amount of time during the day (excluding sleep) that I didn't see my sister. Such a dramatic change in my life has made me more closed off, much more affectionate with my friends and my sister (on the rare occasions that I see her), and generally more stressed. But these are the negatives; I think for myself and share my opinions more often, have stronger social skills, and am more confident as I know I can handle life without my sister. Although I love my sister's company, I've realized this year that too much of a good thing is a bad thing too. <br>
  <br>
  I'm five minutes older than my sister, but apparently, I act like I'm five years older. My mom and my sister joke that I'm afflicted with the condition of uber-bossiness and arrogance, a condition affectionately named 'big sister syndrome' in my family (ironically, my mother has it too). Even though they tease me about it, my parents have always encouraged my 'older-sisterness'; I've always been told that I'll be the one taking care of my family when I'm older. I know that although that doesn't include my sister (she definitely doesn't need me to take care of her), unconsciously I've decided to take care of my sister too, an instinct that my sister despises. There are other expectations I have to live up to also as not only a twin but an older twin. Shreya and I are meant to be total equals, yet we're not (i.e. she's more eloquent than me, and thus is better at expressing her ideas through words whereas I'm better at expressing my ideas through art). If I had a nickel for every time someone asked us a question like "So, who's the smarter twin?" I'd have more money than I'd know what to do with. Prior to entering high school, I think that neither of us really believed that one was better than the other, but these constant questions have sown the seeds of doubt in both of us. There's pressure put upon us to both be the same, yet one of us also has to be slightly better. Because we are twins, any differences (especially in our strengths and weaknesses) between us are amplified and portrayed in a negative light, even though it's natural and healthy for us to be different- we're not clones, after all. <br>
  <br>
  Many times I've imagined what my sister and I would be like if we weren't related. Would we still be friends? (Yes, as long as we lived in the same area.) What if she didn't exist? How would I be different? (That question itself would require another essay to answer.) There's a certain duality to being a twin: it's not all good and it's not all bad, much like anything else in life, and I have to accept that. Being a twin is an identity-snatching, friendship-ruining, stressful and emotional rollercoaster than never ever stops. So why, if given the choice between being a twin or an only child, would I pick being a twin without a second thought? Because I know the secret of the girls in the picture. </p>
